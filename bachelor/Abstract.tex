\chapter{Abstract}
This thesis discusses the PINCH heuristic, a specific implementation of the additive heuristic. PINCH intends to combine the strengths of existing implementations of the additive heuristic. The goal of this thesis is to really dig into the PINCH heuristic. I want to provide the most accessible resource for understanding PINCH and I want to analyze the performance of PINCH by comparing it to the algorithm on which it is based, Generalized Dijkstra.
